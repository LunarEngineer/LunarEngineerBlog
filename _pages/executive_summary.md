Individualized educational assistance at scale is not feasible, especially for economically impoverished areas.

The goal of Lunar Engineering is to aid in transforming the educational industry by providing autonomous individualized educational assistance at scale.

This is achieved using an algorithm to build and maintain a tree data structure used to sample information from in order to maximize the rate of learner information gain and retention affected by intelligent sampling. This is used in a recommendation system.

In less technical terms, think of this like a Librarian, of sorts, that learns to anticipate which training material is most likely to help a learner master a topic.

Success in this project is marked by all learners being optimized for growth, measured via an educational framework.
