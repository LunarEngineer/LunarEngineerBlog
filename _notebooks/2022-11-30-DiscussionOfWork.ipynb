    "Armies of people grouped together on a field, arrayed in patterns and structures, waving flags and sending riders on horses to communicate, can pretend (moderately well) to be a computation engine. Pretty neat.\n",

    "To get an idea for how this works at a very low level, you should check out the book [Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code). The first few chapters do a pretty good job of explaining how a computer is built and used; that analogy, using people, created a living computer in the book. In *real life* we create computers using silicon. The lines of communication are ever smaller routes for electricity to flow between simple components."
